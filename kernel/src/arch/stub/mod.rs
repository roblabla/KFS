//! Stub implementation of the arch-independant API
//!
//! This is the stub implementation of the arch-independant API. Its aim is to
//! ease porting efforts by providing a copy-pastable module to start a new
//! implementation of the arch-specific component, and to provide the test builds
//! with a simple implementation.
